Yacine Ghanmouni sat at the front of the lecture hall, golden-brown curls tucked under a black beanie, one hand holding a pen he wasn’t really using. His hoodie swallowed his lean frame, but nothing could hide the soft, unreal prettiness of his face. A walking distraction. A real-life daydream.

Ibrahim leaned back in his seat, long legs stretched out, boots up on the desk like he owned the place—and maybe he did, in his own way. People looked when he walked in. Some admired, some glared. He didn’t care either way. He only had eyes for one thing: Yacine.

And today, he was making his move.

Class ended with the usual shuffle. Students hurried out. Yacine stayed behind, still scribbling in his notebook. Maybe it was real notes. Maybe it was sketches. Ibrahim didn’t care. He slid from his seat and strolled down the aisle like a wolf scenting his favorite weakness.

“Hey, pretty boy,” he said, voice low and lazy.

“You always this quiet, or am I making you shy?” Ibrahim murmured.

“You’re intense,” Yacine replied, cheeks glowing red.

“Good. You like intense,” Ibrahim said, tilting his head. “Come to my place tonight. I’ve got wine, records, and a couch that’s way too big for just one person.”

Yacine hesitated. Bit his lip. And Ibrahim nearly groaned.

“You’re trouble,” Yacine whispered.

“I’m exactly the kind of trouble you’ve been thinking about,” Ibrahim shot back, hand brushing Yacine’s just enough to make it a promise.

Yacine finally looked up at him, eyes burning now. “Okay. Tonight.”

Ibrahim smirked, stood, and walked away without another word—because seduction wasn’t about begging. It was about letting them chase the fire.

Behind him, Yacine was already packing his things fast, heart thundering, lips smiling. He’d just signed up for something dangerous.

And he couldn’t wait.
